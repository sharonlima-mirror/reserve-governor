// QUESTION: Can voting power be manipulated between snapshot and execution?

A hybrid optimistic/pessimistic governance system for the Reserve protocol.

## Overview

Reserve Governor provides two proposal paths through a single timelock:

- **Fast (Optimistic)**: Quick execution after a short veto period, no affirmative voting required
- **Slow (Standard)**: Full voting process with timelock delay

During a fast proposal's veto period, token holders can vote AGAINST. If enough AGAINST votes accumulate to reach the veto threshold, the proposal automatically spawns a full confirmation vote (the slow path) under a new proposal id. This lets routine governance operate efficiently while preserving the community's ability to challenge any proposal.

Fast proposals are protected by a proposer throttle that limits how many optimistic proposals each account can create per 12-hour window.

## Architecture

The runtime system consists of five components:

1. **StakingVault** -- ERC4626 vault with vote-locking, dual delegation (standard + optimistic), multi-token rewards, and unstaking delay
2. **UnstakingManager** -- Time-locked withdrawal manager created by StakingVault during initialization
3. **ReserveOptimisticGovernor** -- Hybrid governor unifying optimistic/standard proposal flows in shared OZ Governor storage
4. **OptimisticSelectorRegistry** -- Whitelist of allowed `(target, selector)` pairs for optimistic proposals
5. **TimelockControllerOptimistic** -- Single timelock for execution, with bypass for the optimistic path

└────────────────────────────────┘  └───────────────────────────────┘
```

The governor checks each call in an optimistic proposal against the `OptimisticSelectorRegistry` before creating it. Only whitelisted `(target, selector)` pairs are permitted.
The allowlist is universal: selector permissions do not depend on which optimistic proposer submits the proposal.

## Dual Delegation Model

`StakingVault` tracks two independent delegation ledgers against the same vault share balance:

- **Standard delegation** uses the inherited OZ `ERC20Votes` checkpoints and powers slow proposals, quorum, and ordinary `getVotes()` lookups
- **Optimistic delegation** uses dedicated optimistic checkpoints and powers fast proposal veto voting through `getOptimisticVotes()`

This means a holder can route standard governance and optimistic veto authority to different delegatees:

- `deposit()` mints shares without assigning either delegation stream
- `depositAndDelegate()` mints shares and delegates both streams
- `delegate()` and `delegateOptimistic()` can point at different addresses
- Share transfers move both standard and optimistic voting weight according to each account's current delegatees
- `delegateOptimisticBySig()` provides signature-based optimistic delegation

The runtime system above is complemented by a deployment and release control plane:

- `ReserveOptimisticGovernorDeployer` deploys new systems from implementation addresses
- `ReserveOptimisticGovernanceVersionRegistry` tracks versioned deployers
- `RewardTokenRegistry` controls which ERC20s may be added as vault reward tokens
- both registries are governed through an external `RoleRegistry` interface


## Governance Flows

### Fast Proposal Lifecycle

Fast proposals use the standard OZ Governor `ProposalState` enum. During the veto period, any token holder can vote, but only `Against` votes are allowed (`For` and `Abstain` revert).

```

│             │     │   reached)  │       (standard flow)
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### Fast-to-Confirmation Transition

When AGAINST votes reach the veto threshold, the governor creates a **new** standard confirmation proposal:

1. The original optimistic proposal remains in `Defeated` state (internally marked with a sentinel veto threshold value)
2. A confirmation proposal is created with description prefix `"Confirmation For: "` and therefore a different `proposalId`
3. The confirmation proposal follows normal standard timing (`Pending` for `votingDelay`, then `Active`)
4. Voting starts fresh on the confirmation proposal (votes and `hasVoted` do **not** carry over from veto phase)

### Slow Proposal Lifecycle

Slow proposals follow the standard OpenZeppelin Governor flow with voting, timelock queuing, and late quorum extension.

### Slow Proposal Paths

| Path | Name            | Flow                                                 | Outcome                     |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| S1   | Success         | Pending -> Active -> Succeeded -> Queued -> Executed | Normal governance execution |
| S2   | Voting Defeated | Pending -> Active -> Defeated                        | Proposal rejected by voters |
| S3   | Cancellation    | Anything -> Canceled                                 | Canceled                    |

## Veto Mechanism

During a fast proposal's veto period, any token holder can vote using the standard `castVote()` interface, but only `Against` votes are allowed for optimistic proposals. Fast proposals count weight from the vault's optimistic delegation checkpoints (`getPastOptimisticVotes()`), while slow proposals continue to use the standard `ERC20Votes` checkpoints.

**Veto threshold calculation:**

```
vetoThreshold = ceil(vetoThresholdRatio * pastTotalSupply / 1e18)
```

Where `pastTotalSupply = token.getPastTotalSupply(snapshot)` and `vetoThresholdRatio` is a D18 fraction (e.g. `0.1e18` = 10%).

If the veto threshold is reached, the proposal is Defeated and automatically transitions to a confirmation vote via a new proposal id. If the veto period expires without reaching the threshold, the proposal Succeeds and can be executed immediately via timelock bypass. If the snapshot `pastTotalSupply` is zero (so computed threshold in tokens is zero), the optimistic proposal resolves to `Canceled`.

## Proposal Kind Detection

Use `isOptimistic(proposalId)` to determine if a proposal is optimistic or standard. The result cannot change over the lifetime of a proposal.

## Roles

| Role                       | Held By                                                   | Permissions                                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE` | Designated proposer EOAs                                  | Create fast proposals (`proposeOptimistic`)                             |
| `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE` | Designated guardian manager addresses on `Guardian` | Grant new optimistic guardian addresses through `Guardian`              |
| `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE` | Designated optimistic guardian addresses on `Guardian` | Cancel non-defeated optimistic proposals through `Guardian`             |
| `PROPOSER_ROLE`            | Governor contract                                         | Schedule operations on the timelock (granted automatically by Deployer) |
| `EXECUTOR_ROLE`            | Governor contract                                         | Execute timelock operations for both slow and fast proposal paths       |
| `CANCELLER_ROLE`           | Governor contract + shared `Guardian`                     | Cancel proposals (fast or slow), revoke optimistic proposers            |

**IMPORTANT**: Roles held exclusively by the Governor contract (`PROPOSER_ROLE`/`EXECUTOR_ROLE`) should NEVER be granted to other addresses. This could result in executing actions through the timelock without a delay.

> **Note:** Standard (slow) proposals are created via `propose()` by any account meeting `proposalThreshold`. The `PROPOSER_ROLE` on the timelock is held by the governor contract itself -- it allows the governor to schedule operations, not individual users to create proposals.

> **Guardian Architecture:** Each governance timelock grants its only external `CANCELLER_ROLE` to a shared `Guardian` singleton. That `Guardian` uses `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` for break-glass authority, `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE` for routine optimistic guardian additions, and `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE` for optimistic-only bot keys. Rotating optimistic guardian keys therefore only requires updating the shared `Guardian`, not each governance instance. Separately, `RoleRegistry` may still model an emergency council that serves as an admin/controller for the shared `Guardian`.

#### OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE

The `OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE` is managed on the timelock via standard AccessControl:

- Granted via `timelock.grantRole(OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE, address)`
- Revoked via `timelock.revokeRole(OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE, address)` or `timelock.revokeOptimisticProposer(address)` (callable by `CANCELLER_ROLE`, which is held externally by `Guardian`)
- Checked via `timelock.hasRole(OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE, address)`
- Revocation blocks new `proposeOptimistic()` calls by that account
- Execution of a succeeded optimistic proposal is done via `execute(...)` and is not restricted to the original optimistic proposer

#### OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE

The `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE` is managed on the shared `Guardian` via standard `AccessControlEnumerable`:

- Granted via standard role management on `Guardian`
- Checked via `guardian.hasRole(OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE, address)`
- Allows calling `guardian.grantOptimisticGuardian(address)` to add a new `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE`
- Does NOT allow `revokeRole(OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE, address)`; that remains restricted to `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on `Guardian`
- Does NOT allow `cancel(...)` or `revokeOptimisticProposer(...)`

#### OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE

The `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE` is managed on the shared `Guardian` via `AccessControlEnumerable` plus a dedicated manager-only grant helper:

- Granted via `guardian.grantOptimisticGuardian(address)` (callable by `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE`)
- Revoked via `guardian.revokeRole(OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE, address)` (callable by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`)
- Checked via `guardian.hasRole(OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE, address)`
- Allows calling `guardian.cancel(...)` for optimistic proposals in any non-defeated state
- Does NOT allow canceling ordinary standard proposals or pending confirmation proposals
- Does NOT allow `revokeOptimisticProposer()`; that remains restricted to `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on `Guardian`

#### CANCELLER_ROLE

The `CANCELLER_ROLE` is granted on each timelock to the governor contract and the shared `Guardian`. `Guardian`'s `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` holders are expected to revoke an optimistic proposer if they become malicious or otherwise compromised. This includes directly proposing malicious proposals as well as indirect griefing actions such as stuffing a proposal with excess data to increase the gas cost of veto actions.

## Contract Reference

### ReserveOptimisticGovernor

The main hybrid governor contract.

**Fast Proposal Functions:**

- `proposeOptimistic(targets, values, calldatas, description)` -- Create a fast proposal (requires `OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE`)
- `execute(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash)` -- Execute a succeeded fast proposal (bypass path, no queue step)

**Standard Proposal Functions (inherited from OZ Governor):**

- `propose(targets, values, calldatas, description)` -- Create a standard proposal (requires `proposalThreshold`)
- `castVote(proposalId, support)` -- Cast a vote (works on both fast and slow proposals; optimistic proposals only allow `support = 0` / `Against`)
- `queue(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash)` -- Queue a succeeded standard proposal (optimistic proposals cannot be queued)
- `execute(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash)` -- Execute a queued standard proposal or a succeeded optimistic proposal
- `cancel(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash)` -- Cancel a proposal (`CANCELLER_ROLE` can cancel any proposal; the original proposer can cancel pending standard proposals; the original proposer can cancel optimistic proposals directly; `Guardian` may forward guardian cancellations)

**Proposal Creation Rules:**

- `proposeOptimistic()` consumes proposer throttle charge
- `propose()` rejects non-empty calldata calls to EOAs (`InvalidCall`) but allows pure ETH transfers to EOAs with empty calldata
- `proposeOptimistic()` requires each target to be a deployed contract and each calldata entry to include at least a selector (>=4 bytes)
- `proposeOptimistic()` requires `OPTIMISTIC_PROPOSER_ROLE` and each `(target, selector)` to be allowlisted in `OptimisticSelectorRegistry`

**State Query:**

- `isOptimistic(proposalId)` -- Returns whether proposal is optimistic metadata
- `state(proposalId)` -- Returns `ProposalState` (unified for both types)
- `vetoThreshold(proposalId)` -- Returns the veto threshold for an optimistic proposal (0 if standard)
- `getOptimisticVotes(account, timepoint)` -- Read the optimistic voting weight used for fast-proposal veto voting
- `selectorRegistry()` -- The OptimisticSelectorRegistry contract address
- `proposalNeedsQueuing(proposalId)` -- Always `false` for optimistic proposals

**Configuration:**

- `setOptimisticParams(params)` -- Update optimistic governance parameters (onlyGovernance)
- `setProposalThrottle(capacity)` -- Update optimistic proposals-per-12h throttle capacity (onlyGovernance)
- `proposalThrottleCapacity()` -- Read current throttle capacity

### OptimisticSelectorRegistry

Whitelist of allowed `(target, selector)` pairs for optimistic proposals. Controlled by the timelock (governance-controlled).

**Management (onlyTimelock):**

- `registerSelectors(SelectorData[])` -- Add allowed `(target, selector)` pairs
- `unregisterSelectors(SelectorData[])` -- Remove allowed pairs; does NOT impact existing optimistic proposals

**Query:**

- `isAllowed(target, selector)` -- Check if a `(target, selector)` tuple is whitelisted
- `targets()` -- List all targets that have at least one registered selector
- `selectorsAllowed(target)` -- List all allowed selectors for a given target

**Constraints:**

- Cannot register itself as a target
- The governor, timelock, and StakingVault (token) are additionally blocked as targets

### TimelockControllerOptimistic

Extended timelock supporting both flows.

- Slow proposals use standard `scheduleBatch()` + `executeBatch()`
- Fast proposals use `executeBatchBypass()` for immediate execution (governor must hold `PROPOSER_ROLE` and `EXECUTOR_ROLE`)
- `revokeOptimisticProposer(account)` -- Revoke an optimistic proposer (requires `CANCELLER_ROLE`)
- In production wiring, the only external `CANCELLER_ROLE` holder should be the shared `Guardian`
- UUPS upgradeable; `_authorizeUpgrade()` only allows self-calls from the timelock proxy itself

### Guardian

Shared guardian contract intended to be the sole external `CANCELLER_ROLE` holder across all timelocks.

- Uses `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` for full guardian authority
- Uses `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE` to grant new optimistic guardian keys
- Uses `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE` for optimistic-only guardian bot keys
- `grantOptimisticGuardian(account)` -- Grant `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE` to `account` (`OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE` only)
- `cancel(governor, targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash)` -- Forward a cancellation to a governor:
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` may cancel any proposal that the timelock guardian can cancel
  - `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE` may only cancel optimistic proposals, and not once they are `Defeated`
- `revokeOptimisticProposer(governor, account)` -- Revoke an optimistic proposer through the target governor's timelock (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` only)
- Role storage uses `AccessControlEnumerable`, with a dedicated grant helper for optimistic guardians:
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is self-admin
  - `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_MANAGER_ROLE` is administered by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`
  - `OPTIMISTIC_GUARDIAN_ROLE` is administered by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`

### ReserveOptimisticGovernorDeployer

Versioned factory for full system deployments.

- Stores immutable pointers to `versionRegistry`, `rewardTokenRegistry`, `guardian`, `stakingVaultImpl`, `governorImpl`, `timelockImpl`, and `selectorRegistryImpl`
- `deployWithNewStakingVault(baseParams, newStakingVaultParams, deploymentNonce)` -- Deploy a new `StakingVault` proxy and the timelock/governor/selector-registry stack
- `deployWithExistingStakingVault(baseParams, existingStakingVault, deploymentNonce)` -- Deploy the timelock/governor/selector-registry stack around an already deployed vault
- During deployment, grants `CANCELLER_ROLE` on each timelock to the governor contract and the shared `Guardian`
- `BaseDeploymentParams` includes optimistic proposers but no per-instance guardian or optimistic-guardian address lists; optimistic guardian management is centralized in `Guardian`

### RewardTokenRegistry

Governance-owned registry of tokens that may be used as `StakingVault` reward tokens. 

- `registerRewardToken(rewardToken)` -- Register a reward token (owner only)
- `unregisterRewardToken(rewardToken)` -- Unregister a reward token (owner or emergency council via `RoleRegistry`)
- `getAllRewardTokens()` -- Return all reward tokens, even those not registered with the registry anymore
- `isRegistered(rewardToken)` -- Check whether a token is currently in the registry

### ReserveOptimisticGovernanceVersionRegistry

Governance-owned registry of release versions.

- `registerVersion(deployer)` -- Register a new deployer version (owner only)
- `deprecateVersion(versionHash)` -- Mark a version as deprecated (owner or emergency council via `RoleRegistry`)
- `getLatestVersion()` -- Return the latest registered version metadata
- `getImplementationsForVersion(versionHash)` -- Resolve the upgradeable implementation set for a version

### StakingVault

ERC4626 vault with vote-locking, dual delegation, and multi-token rewards. Users deposit tokens to receive vault shares that can carry separate standard and optimistic voting power.

**User Functions:**

- `depositAndDelegate(assets)` -- Deposit tokens and self-delegate both standard and optimistic voting power
- `delegate(delegatee)` -- Delegate standard voting power for slow proposals and quorum (inherited from `ERC20Votes`)
- `delegateOptimistic(delegatee)` -- Delegate optimistic voting power for fast-proposal veto voting
- `delegateOptimisticBySig(delegatee, nonce, expiry, v, r, s)` -- Signature-based optimistic delegation
- `claimRewards(rewardTokens[])` -- Claim accumulated rewards for specified reward tokens
- `poke()` -- Trigger reward accrual without performing an action

**Admin Functions (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE):**

- `addRewardToken(rewardToken)` -- Add a new reward token for distribution
- `removeRewardToken(rewardToken)` -- Remove a reward token from distribution
- `setUnstakingDelay(delay)` -- Set the delay before unstaked tokens can be claimed
- `setRewardRatio(rewardHalfLife)` -- Set the exponential decay half-life for reward distribution

**Other:**

- `getAllRewardTokens()` -- Return all active reward tokens
- `optimisticDelegates(account)` -- Return the current optimistic delegate for an account
- `getOptimisticVotes(account)` -- Return the latest optimistic delegated voting weight
- `getPastOptimisticVotes(account, timepoint)` -- Return optimistic voting weight at a past timestamp snapshot
- `rewardTokenRegistry()` -- Reward token registry wired in during initialization
- `versionRegistry()` -- Version registry wired in during initialization

**Properties:**

- UUPS upgradeable by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, but only to the exact latest non-deprecated staking-vault implementation registered in `ReserveOptimisticGovernanceVersionRegistry`
- Clock: timestamp-based (ERC5805)
- Creates an `UnstakingManager` during initialization
- Standard and optimistic delegatees are tracked independently on the same share balance
- `addRewardToken()` only accepts tokens that are currently registered in `RewardTokenRegistry`

#### Valid Ranges

StakingVault asset tokens and reward tokens are assumed to be maximum 1e36 supply and up to 21 decimals.

#### Governance Guidelines

If governance removes a reward token via `removeRewardToken()`, that token is disallowed from being re-added. Users can still claim already accrued rewards for removed/disallowed reward tokens via `claimRewards()`.

### UnstakingManager

Time-locked withdrawal manager, created by StakingVault during initialization.

**Functions:**

- `createLock(user, amount, unlockTime)` -- Create a new unstaking lock (vault only)
- `claimLock(lockId)` -- Claim tokens after unlock time is reached (anyone can call; tokens go to lock owner)
- `cancelLock(lockId)` -- Cancel a lock and re-deposit tokens into the vault (lock owner only)

**Lock Struct:**

- `user` -- Receiver of unstaked tokens
- `amount` -- Amount of tokens locked
- `unlockTime` -- Timestamp when tokens become claimable
- `claimedAt` -- Timestamp when claimed (0 if not yet claimed)

### Parameter Constraints

| Parameter                  | Constraint                               | Constant                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `vetoDelay`                | >= 1 second and < `MAX_OPTIMISTIC_DELAY` | `MIN_OPTIMISTIC_VETO_DELAY`, `MAX_OPTIMISTIC_DELAY` |
| `vetoPeriod`               | >= 5 minutes                             | `MIN_OPTIMISTIC_VETO_PERIOD`                        |
| `vetoThreshold`            | > 0 and <= 100%                          |                                                     |
| `proposalThrottleCapacity` | >= 1 and <= 12 proposals/12h            | `MAX_PROPOSAL_THROTTLE_CAPACITY`                    |
| `votingDelay`              | < `MAX_OPTIMISTIC_DELAY`                 | `MAX_OPTIMISTIC_DELAY`                              |
| `proposalThreshold`        | > 0 and <= 100%                          |                                                     |

The contract allows a `vetoPeriod` as low as 5 minutes, but this is not recommended. The lowest recommended production value is 15 minutes.

Similarly, `proposalThrottleCapacity` as high as 12 proposals/12h is allowed but not recommended. 

### Proposal Throttle Behavior

- Throttle is tracked per proposer account for `proposeOptimistic()`
- Capacity is measured as proposals per 12 hours
- Each optimistic proposal consumes one unit of capacity
- Capacity recharges linearly over time (full recharge over 12 hours)

### StakingVault Parameters

| Parameter        | Constraint       | Constant                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `unstakingDelay` | <= 4 weeks       | `MAX_UNSTAKING_DELAY`                          |
| `rewardHalfLife` | 1 day to 2 weeks | `MIN_REWARD_HALF_LIFE`, `MAX_REWARD_HALF_LIFE` |

## Optimistic Call Restrictions

Fast (optimistic) proposals can **only** call `(target, selector)` pairs registered in the `OptimisticSelectorRegistry`. In addition, the following targets are **always** blocked at registration time (hardcoded in `OptimisticSelectorRegistry`):

- The `StakingVault` contract (token)
- The `ReserveOptimisticGovernor` contract
- The `TimelockControllerOptimistic` contract
- The `OptimisticSelectorRegistry` itself

Any governance changes to the system itself must go through the slow proposal path with full community voting.

Additional optimistic validations:

- Every optimistic target must be a contract (no EOAs)
- Every optimistic calldata entry must be non-empty (>= 4 bytes selector)

## Upgradeability

Three contracts are UUPS upgradeable, but they do not share a central onchain upgrade manager.

| Contract                       | Upgrade Authorization                                         | Additional Guardrail |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `StakingVault`                 | `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`                                | Upgrade must be executed through the timelock via standard governance path AND update StakingVault to latest release |
| `ReserveOptimisticGovernor`    | `onlyGovernance`                                              | Upgrade must be executed through the timelock via standard governance path |
| `TimelockControllerOptimistic` | `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`                                | Upgrade must be executed through the timelock via standard governance path            |

`OptimisticSelectorRegistry` is clone-initialized and is not upgradeable.

### Version Registry (StakingVault)

`ReserveOptimisticGovernanceVersionRegistry` stores versions by deployer, not by a raw implementation tuple. Only `StakingVault` upgrades are currently tied to the version registry. 

- `registerVersion(deployer)` can only be called by a `RoleRegistry` owner
- `getLatestVersion()` returns the latest registered version metadata
- `getImplementationsForVersion(versionHash)` resolves the staking vault, governor, and timelock implementations from the registered deployer
- `deprecateVersion(versionHash)` can be called by a `RoleRegistry` owner or emergency council

### Upgrade Flows

> New `StakingVault` implementations MUST remain backwards compatible with older `ReserveOptimisticGovernor` and `TimelockControllerOptimistic` implementations. Functionality should NOT be removed.


Upgrades are intended to be executed by the existing vault admin. They cannot be routed through the optimistic path. 

1. Deploy new implementations and a new versioned `ReserveOptimisticGovernorDeployer` pointing at those implementation addresses plus the shared version and reward-token registries.
2. Register that deployer in `ReserveOptimisticGovernanceVersionRegistry` from a `RoleRegistry` owner account.
3. Apply upgrades per component:
   1. `StakingVault`: call `upgradeToAndCall(newStakingVaultImpl, data)` from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` (usually timelock). The `newStakingVaultImpl.version()` must be the latest registered (non-deprecated) version.
   2. `ReserveOptimisticGovernor`: call `governor.upgradeToAndCall(newGovernorImpl, data)` from timelock.
   3. `TimelockControllerOptimistic`: call `timelock.upgradeToAndCall(newTimelockImpl, data)` from timelock.

Only the `StakingVault` upgrade path is constrained by the version registry. This guarantees that `StakingVault` governance cannot brick the other governors that also depend on the same `StakingVault`. However, each `ReserveOptimisticGovernor` and `TimelockControllerOptimistic` depending on a StakingVault (or governing it) can be broken either via role changes or by upgrading to a malicious implementation. 

For deployments created with `deployWithExistingStakingVault()`, the new timelock does not automatically become the existing vault's admin. Any later `StakingVault` upgrade is still controlled by whichever address currently holds that vault's `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.


## Flow Summary

```
Fast Proposal:
  proposeOptimistic() -> [vetoDelay: PENDING] -> [vetoPeriod: ACTIVE]
                                                    |
                                                    +-- threshold not met --> SUCCEEDED -> execute() -> EXECUTED (bypass)
                                                    |
                                                    +-- threshold reached --> DEFEATED (original)
                                                                                -> Confirmation Proposal (new id)
                                                                                -> [voting delay: PENDING]
                                                                                -> [voting period: ACTIVE]
                                                                                -> queue() -> [timelock] -> execute()

Slow Proposal:
  propose() -> [voting delay] -> [voting period] -> queue() -> [timelock] -> execute()
```
